Tim's Nuggets of Wisdom:
* my general experience with personal farming is that you usually get tons of smaller items that sell for small amounts of gold if you ah them and there is generally only like one or two rare things even at that location
* I think they should be named so that different farming spots feel different
* but keep it to no more then 5 things at one spot, 1-3 types of trash and 1-2 types rare items
* most farming results in hundreds of trash and like 1 rare thing
on the ah:
* no, I see only two stats that matter
   * the daily price which goes up and down
   * and the supply of that one item on the ah
* maybe just have a daily price that goes up and down and you can choose how much you want to sell on that day at the end
* I think for now I would focus on the basic mmo experience for now
